# Landing Page Project

This project is the part of a Front-end Nanodegree programme by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

The project is about making a landing page dynamic by using JavaScript, css and html together. The requirements are to build a dynamic menu that is based on the sections within the html and to scroll dynamically to the specific section, when the item in the menu is clicked. At the same time the corresponding section should be highlighted.
